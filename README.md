# QR Code Generator

The QR code generator is a web app, which helps you to generate QR codes and Style them however you want.
It is part of a series of web apps, which are all centered around being free to use, without ads and without any tracking. The idea came to me, because there are so many free to use js libraries but they dont have a ui, so that people can use them without coding knowledge.
